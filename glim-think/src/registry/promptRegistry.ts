/**
 * Prompt/criteria registry — the actuation substrate for the self-improving
 * eval loop.
 *
 * Agents read their system prompt through `getPrompt(agentClass)` instead of
 * hardcoding it. The active variant per agent is pointed to by active.json;
 * the variant text lives in src/registry/prompts/<Class>.<variant>.md and is
 * compiled into prompts.gen.ts (Worker bundles can't read .md at runtime).
 *
 * The Evolver (evals/evolver.ts) closes the loop: it writes a new
 * <Class>.<variant>.md, bumps active.json, and the CI deploy regenerates
 * prompts.gen.ts so the new prompt is live — confined to src/registry/ by the
 * Evolver's path allowlist, with the regression gate as backstop.
 *
 * Resolution order for getPrompt(cls):
 *   PROMPTS[`${cls}.${active[cls]}`]  →  PROMPTS[`${cls}.v1`]
 *   →  PROMPTS["GlimThinkAgent.v1"] (base default)  →  hard fallback string.
