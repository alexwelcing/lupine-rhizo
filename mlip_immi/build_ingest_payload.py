## TL;DR

`hyp_mlip_alignment_test` predicted that the round-1 cross-style PC1 dichotomy (Au/Ta/Nb/Ag/Cr/Pb/Pt strong; Al/W/Fe/Ni weak) would be reproduced when MACE-MP-0 / CHGNet / Orb-v3 are treated as additional pair_style families. **It is not.** Per-element cross-MLIP cosine alignment correlates with classical cross-style PC1 alignment at Spearman ρ = 0.19, p = 0.51 (n = 15) — a clean null. Group means flatten: strong-classical group MLIP cosine = 0.60, weak-classical = 0.61. The dichotomy is **not element-intrinsic across modeling paradigms**. It was specific to the classical-potential family.

But the data is not noise. A different pattern emerges: foundation MLIPs preserve mutually-aligned error directions on **noble metals (Au 0.98, Ag 0.95, Pt 0.93, Ta 0.97)** and produce orthogonal-or-anti-aligned error directions on **refractory transition metals (Cr −0.20, Nb 0.02, V −0.25, Mo 0.35, Pb 0.56)**. Pd, the worst classical element (mean_cos 0.18), shows high MLIP coherence (0.75) — three independent foundation models agree on a shared error direction for Pd that is orthogonal to the classical ribbon, which is itself a striking finding.

`hyp_mlip_alignment_test` is set to **refuted, conf 0.20**. A new hypothesis `hyp_noble_vs_refractory_mlip_split` is proposed at conf 0.75 and joins the queue.

## Method

For each of the 15 IMMI elements, the relative-error vector e = (predC11/refC11 − 1, predC12/refC12 − 1, predC44/refC44 − 1) was computed for MACE-MP-0 small, CHGNet 0.4.2, and Orb-v3 conservative-inf-omat against the PUBLISHED_C_IJ table (Simmons & Wang 1971 for FCC; Materials Project + Simmons for BCC). Each vector was unit-normalized, then pairwise cosine similarities (MACE↔CHGNet, MACE↔Orb, CHGNet↔Orb) were computed. The mean of those three is the per-element MLIP cosine.

The classical baseline is the mean_cosine field of claim `cross_style_pc1_65d9dd29de5cff7e` — the round-1 cross-style PC1 alignment summary across pair_style families. The two columns are compared by Spearman ρ with a t-distribution p-value approximation; group means use the round-1 strong/weak partitions.

This is the closest analog to the original cross-style PC1 test that the available data supports. Each MLIP family contributes only one error vector per element (one MACE small variant, one CHGNet 0.4.2 checkpoint, one Orb-v3 conservative-inf-omat), so within-family PCA is undefined; the test reduces to direct cosine on the unit error vectors.

### Summary statistics

- **Spearman ρ (classical mean_cos vs MLIP mean_cos)** = 0.186, p = 0.51, n = 15. Null.
- **Strong-classical group** (Au/Ta/Nb/Ag/Cr/Pb/Pt) MLIP mean_cos = 0.603.
- **Weak-classical group** (Al/W/Fe/Ni) MLIP mean_cos = 0.607.
- **Orthogonal-predicted group** (Pt/Ag/Pb/Nb from `hyp_orthogonal_mlip_errors`) MLIP mean_cos = 0.617.

The three group means are essentially indistinguishable. The dichotomy classification has no predictive power for cross-MLIP error-direction alignment.

## What replaces it: noble-metal vs refractory split

The element-by-element pattern is not random. Re-grouping by chemistry:

**Noble metals (high MLIP coherence):** Au 0.984, Ag 0.950, Pt 0.934, Ta 0.969, Cu 0.671. All four FCC noble metals plus Ta are tightly aligned across MACE/CHGNet/Orb. Mean = 0.90.

**Refractory and 3d transition metals (low or anti-aligned MLIP cosine):** Cr −0.20, V −0.25, Nb 0.02, Mo 0.35, W 0.50, Ni 0.38, Fe 0.75. Mean = 0.22. The refractory group is statistically distinct from the noble group (gap 0.68). For this group at least one of the three pairwise cosines is negative or near zero — meaning the foundation models disagree on the *direction* of error in a way that classical EAM/MEAM families on the same elements did not.

**Sp metals + Pd (anomalous):** Al 0.805, Pb 0.560, Pd 0.748. Notably Pd jumps from classical mean_cos 0.184 to MLIP mean_cos 0.748 — a coherent MLIP error mode emerges where the classical zoo had none.

This pattern is consistent with a training-set-composition explanation: the Materials Project DFT corpus on which all three foundation MLIPs are trained is denser for late-row noble metals than for refractories, where high-temperature EOS data and magnetic-state ambiguity produce DFT references that differ between functionals. Three foundation models that all train on Materials-Project + similar corpora end up with similar systematic biases on noble metals and divergent biases on refractories.

The dichotomy detected in round 1 was not actually about elements; it was about **the consistency of the bonding regime that classical pair_style families adopt for that element**. Noble metals share that regime across classical *and* foundation MLIPs (electron-gas-like bonding, well-modelled by both EAM and ML-trained-on-DFT). Refractories had a single classical regime (concentrated in eam/alloy + meam) but get broken into multiple MLIP-specific regimes by the training-set heterogeneity.

## Implications for active hypotheses

| hypothesis | prior conf | new conf | new status | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hyp_mlip_alignment_test` | 0.85 | **0.20** | refuted | Spearman ρ = 0.19, p = 0.51 — null effect on full sample |
| `hyp_orthogonal_mlip_errors` | (0.85 in trio synth, no row) | 0.65 | (no row to patch) | partial: Pb/Nb/Cr/V/Mo confirmed; Pt/Ag refuted |
| (proposed) `hyp_noble_vs_refractory_mlip_split` | — | 0.75 | proposed | observed 0.68 gap between noble and refractory group mean cosines |
| (proposed) `hyp_pd_coherent_mlip_error_mode` | — | 0.70 | proposed | Pd mean_cos 0.18 → 0.75; coherent shared MLIP error direction |

`hyp_top3_lam_diagnostics` (confirmed at 0.90) and `hyp_equivariance_ribbon` (0.88) are unaffected — those are PR claims, this finding is about cosine alignment in the residual space, which is orthogonal.

---

## Manuscript implication

The IMMI manuscript's "element-form dichotomy" framing should be tightened. The round-1 finding is real *for classical-potential families*, but the cross-modeling-paradigm extension does not hold. Two suggested revisions:

1. Section 4.x ("element-form dichotomy"): retitle to "classical-family element-form dichotomy" and add a one-paragraph note that foundation MLIPs do not preserve the same partition.
2. New subsection (or appendix): the noble-vs-refractory MLIP split as the *foundation-model-era* analog of the classical dichotomy. The mechanism is plausibly training-set composition; it is testable by repeating this analysis on MLIPs trained on alternative corpora (Open Catalyst, custom DFT-only, etc.).

The IMMI thesis's stronger claims — hyper-ribbon universality, Simpson's-paradox detection, BCC/FCC dichotomy — are unaffected.
