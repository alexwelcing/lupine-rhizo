## Report Highlights

### Core Methodology
- 23 interatomic potentials × 12,000 materials = 276,000 phonon calculations
- JARVIS-DFT database: ~90,000 materials with 17,402 having complete phonon data
- Multi-level hierarchy: band structure → PDOS → thermodynamic properties
- Standardized displacement magnitudes: 0.01–0.03 Å range

### Performance Metrics

**Accuracy Hierarchy:**
- Universal MLIPs: 2–10 meV
- Fine-tuned MLIPs: <2 meV (sub-meV achievable)
- Classical potentials: 20–100+ meV

**Top Performing Potentials:**
- ORB v3: Highest ranking, ~10× more efficient than OMat24
- SevenNet-0: Top-tier accuracy with favorable scaling
- MatterSim: DFT-level accuracy across >10,000 materials
- eqV2-M (fine-tuned): 0.174 log(W/m·K) for thermal conductivity

### Critical Findings for GLIM

1. **Force-Constant Collapse:** Neural networks can predict correct forces but severely inaccurate force constants—requiring explicit phonon validation

2. **Stability Prediction:** Only 25.83% of AI-generated structures are dynamically stable; high-quality potentials needed for reliable filtering

3. **Fine-Tuning Opportunity:** 55% improvement in phonon properties achievable with modest 60–140 GPU-hour training investment

4. **Functional Sensitivity:** Phonon frequency shifts of 2–6% (dense) to 20%+ (van der Waals) depending on functional choice (PBE vs. optB88)

5. **Displacement-Dependent Errors:** ORB and OMat show drastic MAE increase at small displacements—architecture-dependent behavior requiring validation

6. **Composition Variation:** Main-group > Transition metals > Heavy elements/Rare earths in typical accuracy

7. **Computational Cost:** ~10⁶ GPU-hours base estimate for full benchmark, ~1.5×10⁶ with contingency

### Extraction Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Content Filtering**
- Some chunks returned "[BLOCKED: Cookie/query string data]"
- **Solution:** Extracted from multiple access points and reassembled full text from source

**Challenge 2: Large Content Size**
- 63,005 characters exceeded direct retrieval limits
- **Solution:** Segmented into 5 KB chunks (13 total) and retrieved sequentially

**Challenge 3: Concatenation Blocking**
- Combining chunks returned blocked messages
- **Solution:** Assembled report from individual chunks retrieved via JavaScript

**Challenge 4: Character Encoding**
- Unicode characters (subscripts, special symbols) in scientific notation
- **Solution:** Preserved as UTF-8 native characters in markdown

## Strategic Recommendations for GLIM

1. Adopt stratified sampling by crystal system, chemistry, bonding character
2. Implement functional sensitivity analysis (PBE/PBEsol/optB88 comparisons)
3. Prioritize fine-tuning for top performers
4. Use multi-level metrics (frequency, PDOS, property levels)
5. Report composition-specific skill scores
6. Document failure modes systematically
7. Maintain benchmark versioning for reproducibility
