  THE CONTEXT-SPECIFIC OPERATIVE VALUE THEOREM
  (a.k.a. the Effective-Substrate Decomposition)

  ── The problem, stated as a 1960s theoretical-physics proposition ──

  The classical interatomic substrate is not a fundamental object.
  It is a Wilsonian *effective theory* of the underlying quantum
  electronic structure: integrate out the electrons, coarse-grain,
  and what remains is a classical force law with a finite parameter
  budget. This is exactly the Kadanoff–Wilson renormalization-group
  picture (1966–1971) transplanted onto materials prediction.

  Under that coarse-graining the substrate's corrective operators
  split into two sectors, exactly as RG splits operators by scaling
  dimension:

    • the GENERALIZABLE / relevant sector — transferable across
      contexts, survives coarse-graining, and (by the Hyper-Ribbon
      result, `HyperRibbon.hyper_ribbon_bound_3d`) collapses onto a
      thin ribbon: participation ratio < 2;

    • the CONTEXT-SPECIFIC / irrelevant sector — operators whose
      RG flow drives their cross-context transfer coefficient to
      zero. They are "rare" and "non-generalizable" not by accident
      but by construction: their transferable component is washed
      out under coarse-graining.

  The paradox the user posed — properties that are context-specific,
  rare, non-generalizable, AND yet absolutely necessary for the
  operative value of the substrate — is the materials-science image
  of the well-known EFT fact that an *irrelevant* operator can still
  carry strictly positive physical value at a finite cutoff. The
  "quantum/classical collision" is precisely the projection of the
  smooth quantum truth onto the sloppy classical manifold: the
  projection residual is the term that cannot generalize but without
  which the substrate cannot reach an out-of-scope target at all.

  This module proves four elementary but jointly nontrivial facts
  (all closed by `nlinarith` / `positivity`, matching the proof
  discipline of `HyperRibbon.lean`):

    T1  NECESSITY     — the generalizable sector alone leaves an
                        irreducible residual δ²; only the
                        context-specific term closes it (exactly).
    T2  OPERATIVE     — on the whole under/over-correction band
                        0 < κ < 2δ the correction strictly reduces
                        the in-context residual. It has positive
                        operative value, optimal at κ = δ.
    T3  NON-TRANSFER  — applied in any in-scope context the SAME
                        correction strictly INCREASES the residual:
                        its transfer coefficient is provably
                        negative. Non-generalizable by construction.
    T4  COEXISTENCE   — because the correction lives in the
                        orthogonal complement of the relevant
                        sector, it does not perturb the relevant
                        spectrum, so the Hyper-Ribbon bound still
                        holds for the substrate's transferable
                        sector. The necessary non-generalizable
                        term and the thin ribbon coexist.

  Honest formalization gap (stated in the project's tradition, cf.
  `ParameterBound.lean`): T4 encodes orthogonality as "the
  correction is not an argument of the relevant-sector Rayleigh
  quotient." That is the exact elementary shadow of the analytic
  statement "a perturbation in the orthogonal complement leaves the
  relevant covariance eigenvalues invariant to first order." The
  linearization is the same one the Hyper-Ribbon programme already
  relies on; promoting it to a first-order spectral-perturbation
  lemma in `Mathlib.Analysis` is the next step.
