  AUTHORED BY THE LUPINE NEURAL-SYMBOLIC LOOP (Node 3) — do not edit by hand.

  Empirical source (Node 1, GPU): model `mace-mp-0`, observable C44 shear on
  `Ni-fcc-shear-sweep`. Measured elastic C44 = 92.4 GPa vs
  reference 124.7 GPa (-25.9%); validated
  shear-strain manifold edge = 0.1000; verdict = reject.

  These are machine-checked negative constraints: an MLIP "hallucination" (a curvature
  prediction outside the empirically-validated manifold) is turned into a formally
  verified statement. Pure core Lean, decided by `native_decide` — 0 sorry.
