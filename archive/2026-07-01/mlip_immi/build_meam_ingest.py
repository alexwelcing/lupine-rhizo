## TL;DR

`hyp_meam_anomaly` claimed that MEAM's full-sample participation ratio (PR = 2.241 in the original `rank_correlation_a53d79830856584a` claim) is anomalously high vs tersoff (PR = 1.008) and tersoff/zbl (PR = 1.000) at the same many-body rank, with MEAM's angular embedded-atom term as the proposed mechanism.

Bootstrap subsampling refutes the comparison. **At sample size n = 7 (matched to tersoff), MEAM's PR distribution has median 1.36 and 5th percentile 1.04** — heavily overlapping tersoff's 1.008. At n = 3 (matched to tersoff/zbl), 8.4% of MEAM bootstrap draws produce PR ≤ tersoff/zbl's 1.000. The "anomaly" is the same artifact pattern the d-band closure already documented: PR is mechanically bounded by min(n, d=3) and the 3×3 covariance estimator has high variance below n ≈ 10.

The standalone claim that MEAM at full n is genuinely sloppy in 2 dimensions does survive: full-n bootstrap CI [1.58, 2.39] excludes a 1-dimensional null. That is a real and reportable property of MEAM — it just isn't a comparison to tersoff at matched conditions.

`hyp_meam_anomaly` is set to **refuted, conf 0.20**. A new hypothesis `hyp_meam_intrinsically_2d` is proposed at conf 0.80 with the narrower, defensible claim.

## Method

Raw potential-level error vectors were assembled from `atlas-distill/benchmarks/nist_populated_all.csv`, filtered to records that have all three of (C11, C12, C44) and a non-zero reference. For each (pair_style, potential, element) triple the relative-error vector e = (predC11/refC11 − 1, predC12/refC12 − 1, predC44/refC44 − 1) was computed; participation ratio of the column-covariance eigenvalue spectrum follows the standard PR = (Σλᵢ)² / Σλᵢ² definition. Bootstrap is 10 000 iterations seeded with `0xC0FFEE`. Without-replacement subsampling for matched-n tests (each draw is a fresh subsample of distinct rows); with-replacement bootstrap for the full-n CI.

The CSV-derived row counts differ slightly from the original `rank_correlation_a53d79830856584a` claim (here: meam n = 108, tersoff n = 2, tersoff/zbl n = 3; original: meam n = 167, tersoff n = 7, tersoff/zbl n = 3). The difference reflects which records had complete (C11, C12, C44) sets and valid references in this snapshot of the CSV; the qualitative finding is robust to this difference because the bootstrap also tests at n = 7 directly to match the original sample size.

## Results

### Observed full-sample PR

| pair_style | n_rows | observed PR |
|---|---|---|
| meam | 108 | **2.068** |
| tersoff | 2 | NaN (degenerate; n < 3) |
| tersoff/zbl | 3 | 1.000 |
| eam | 36 | (computed for context) |
| eam/alloy | 247 | (computed for context) |

### MEAM full-n bootstrap CI (with replacement, 10 000 draws)

PR 95% CI: **[1.576, 2.388]**, median 2.05. The standalone "MEAM is genuinely 2-dimensional sloppy at full n" claim is supported.

### MEAM matched-n distributions (without replacement, 10 000 draws)

| target n | matched to | median PR | p05 | p95 | P(MEAM ≤ comparator PR) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| n = 2 | tersoff (n=2 in this CSV) | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | NaN — tersoff PR undefined at n=2 |
| n = 3 | tersoff/zbl (PR=1.000) | 1.088 | 1.000 | 1.778 | **0.084** |
| n = 7 | original tersoff claim (PR=1.008) | 1.362 | 1.039 | 2.091 | (1.008 sits at p05) |

At n = 7, **17 % of MEAM bootstrap draws produce PR ≤ 1.1** and **62 % produce PR ≤ 1.5**. MEAM at the comparator's sample size is statistically indistinguishable from tersoff. The original difference (2.241 vs 1.008) is dominated by the 24× difference in n.

---

## Mechanism: PR is bounded by min(n, d) — the same artifact pattern as the d-band closure

Participation ratio of a 3×3 covariance is bounded by the rank of the covariance, which for n samples is min(n, 3). At n = 2, the rank is at most 1, so PR ≡ 1 deterministically. At n = 3 the rank can reach 3 but only if the three error vectors span the full 3-d space — most realistic samples won't. By n ≈ 10 the bound becomes effectively non-binding, but the high-variance regime extends well beyond.

This is the same confounder pattern documented in `synthesis_dband_closure_2026_05_04`: a property aggregated across a heterogeneously-sampled set has its apparent variation dominated by sampling depth. Both findings reinforce a methodological lesson — **any IMMI-paper claim that compares PR or alignment across pair_style families must either restrict to comparable n or report a matched-n bootstrap.**

---

## Hypothesis update

| hypothesis | prior conf | new conf | new status | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hyp_meam_anomaly` | 0.50 | **0.20** | refuted | comparison to tersoff at matched n fails |
| (proposed) `hyp_meam_intrinsically_2d` | — | 0.80 | proposed | full-n bootstrap CI [1.58, 2.39] excludes 1-D null |

## Manuscript implication

The IMMI paper's rank-vs-PR analysis should be presented with the matched-n caveat. Two suggested revisions:

1. The rank-3 cell of any pair_style-PR table should report MEAM at full n alongside MEAM-at-n=7 bootstrap CI; tersoff and tersoff/zbl can keep their point estimates with an explicit "n too small for PR to be informative" footnote.
2. Add a one-paragraph methodology note (likely in Methods or supplementary) stating that PR comparisons across families are reported only when n ≥ 10 per family, with bootstrap CIs otherwise. This codifies the same lesson the d-band closure already taught.

This does not affect the BCC/FCC dichotomy or the hyper-ribbon-universality results; those are computed at element-level n that comfortably clears the threshold.
